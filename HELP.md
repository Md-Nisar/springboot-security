## **Introduction**

This document provides step-by-step instructions to build, run, and deploy both the **Spring Boot** backend and **Angular** frontend of the project.

The Spring Boot application provides the backend logic, while the Angular application provides the frontend user interface. Both need to be built and deployed separately.

---

## **Pre-requisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or above)** â€“ Required for the Spring Boot application.
    - Download it from [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
2. **Maven** â€“ For building the Spring Boot project.
    - Install Maven from [Maven Official Website](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).
3. **Node.js and npm** â€“ Required for the Angular project.
    - Install Node.js from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
4. **Angular CLI** â€“ Command-line interface for Angular.
    - Install Angular CLI by running:
      ```bash
      npm install -g @angular/cli
      ```

## **Building the Spring Boot Project**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

If you haven't already cloned the project, clone it from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Spring Boot uses Maven for managing dependencies. Ensure you have Maven installed on your system. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This will download all necessary dependencies specified in the `pom.xml` file.

### **3. Build the Spring Boot Project**

To build the Spring Boot project, use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will create a `.jar` file (in the `target/` directory), which contains the compiled Spring Boot application.

---

## **Building the Angular Project**

### **1. Navigate to the Angular Project Directory**

The Angular project should be located within the `angular-security/` directory. Navigate to that directory:

```bash
cd angular-security
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Angular uses npm to manage dependencies. Install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

### **3. Build the Angular Project**

To build the Angular application for production, use the following command:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

This will create an optimized build of the Angular app in the `dist/` directory.

---

## **Running the Spring Boot Application Locally**

### **1. Run the Application**

To run the Spring Boot application locally, use the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, if you want to run the `.jar` file after building it, execute:

```bash
java -jar target/your-project-name.jar
```

This will start the Spring Boot application on the default port `8080`.

### **2. Verify the Application**

Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` to verify that the Spring Boot application is running successfully.

---

## **Running the Angular Application Locally**

### **1. Serve the Application**

To serve the Angular application locally, use the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

This will start the Angular development server and serve the app on `http://localhost:4200`.

### **2. Verify the Application**

Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:4200` to verify that the Angular frontend is running successfully.

---

## **Deployment**

### **Spring Boot Deployment**

#### **1. Build the Spring Boot Application**

If you haven't already built the `.jar` file, follow the steps mentioned above to run:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will generate the `.jar` file in the `target/` directory.

#### **2. Deploy on a Server**

You can deploy the Spring Boot application on various platforms such as AWS, Heroku, or any other server of your choice. For example:

- **Deploying on AWS EC2**:
    - Copy the `.jar` file to your EC2 instance using `scp` or any file transfer method.
    - SSH into your EC2 instance and run:
      ```bash
      java -jar your-project-name.jar
      ```

- **Deploying on Heroku**:
    - Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
    - Create a new Heroku app:
      ```bash
      heroku create your-app-name
      ```
    - Push the Spring Boot application to Heroku:
      ```bash
      git push heroku main
      ```
    - The app will be available at `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`.

### **Angular Deployment**

#### **1. Build the Angular Application**

To create a production build of the Angular app, use:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

This will generate optimized static files in the `dist/` folder.

#### **2. Deploy on a Web Server**

You can deploy the `dist/` folder to any web server such as Nginx, Apache, or use cloud platforms like AWS S3, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting. For example:

- **Deploy on AWS S3**:
    - Create a new S3 bucket via the AWS console.
    - Upload the contents of the `dist/` folder to the bucket.
    - Enable static website hosting for the bucket.

- **Deploy on Netlify**:
    - Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and log in.
    - Click "New Site from Git" and connect your repository.
    - Set the build command to `ng build --prod` and publish directory to `dist/`.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Spring Boot Application Not Starting**:
    - Ensure that you have the correct JDK version installed.
    - Check for any issues in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` configuration files.
    - Review the logs for any specific error messages.

- **Angular Application Not Loading**:
    - Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.
    - If there are errors related to missing packages, try deleting the `node_modules/` folder and reinstalling:
      ```bash
      rm -rf node_modules/
      npm install
      ```

---

## **Conclusion**

You have successfully built and deployed both the **Spring Boot** and **Angular** applications. Make sure to follow the deployment guidelines for your chosen hosting platform, and don't forget to check the respective documentation for more detailed configuration options.
